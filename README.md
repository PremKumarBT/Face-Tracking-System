# Face-Tracking-System
Developed a system that detects and tracks human faces in real time using a camera. The system automatically adjusts the orientation of the prosthetic eyes using servomotors to follow the detected facial movements. Integrates pyfermita and computer vision techniques with hardware control to achieve smooth and accurate face tracking for robots.

To test or try the project need to have python 3.10.9 and VS Code editor.

Need to Download all the nessary Modules and packages inorder to run properly.

The output will be in the form of live video which is captured from camera and will be having response through servomotors as eyes tracking each path the face covered.

Check the videos and images attached.
