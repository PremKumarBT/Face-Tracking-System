# Face-Tracking-System
Developed a system that detects and tracks human faces in real time using a camera. The system automatically adjusts the orientation of the prosthetic eyes using servomotors to follow the detected facial movements. Integrates pyfermita and computer vision techniques with hardware control to achieve smooth and accurate face tracking for robots.
